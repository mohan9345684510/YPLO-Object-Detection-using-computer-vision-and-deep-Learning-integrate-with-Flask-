# YPLO-Object-Detection-using-computer-vision-and-deep-Learning-integrate-with-Flask-
“Developed a Flask-based computer vision web app using YOLOv8, DeepSORT, and ByteTrack to perform object detection, multi-object tracking, and region-based counting on uploaded videos. The system generates annotated output videos with live counters and summary results.”
